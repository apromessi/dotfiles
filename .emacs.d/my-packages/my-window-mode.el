;; Evil provides some good window navigation functionality, but these
;; bindings aren't available in Emacs state and also consequently in
;; Insert state if the insert mode keymap is overridden in favor of
;; Emacs native bindings. Additionally, for the most common window
;; operations, some of the evil mode defaults could be further
;; improved.  This package provides evil window navigation globally as
;; a Vim-style "mode," implemented using a hydra, and also overrides
;; some defaults to make them faster or more useful/intuitive.
